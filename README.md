Christoffel Menu App
Overview

The Christoffel Menu App is a mobile application built using React Native and Expo Router. It provides an interactive restaurant menu management system that allows two types of users to access the app: Christoffel (Chef) and User.
The Chef can add, view, and remove dishes, while regular users can browse available dishes organized by course. The app also includes animated transitions, an elegant interface, and a help page explaining how to use the system.
